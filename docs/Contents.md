Tips for Pacing and Structure:

Each chapter begins with a teaching segment (10–20 min), followed by a lab (20–30 min).
Labs emphasize hands-on coding in both Python and JavaScript.
The final project/lab ties everything together as a capstone with real-world application.
You’ll wrap up with curated resources and a collaborative Q&A so everyone leaves empowered to keep learning!
