6. Production Workflows: Using Copilot in Real Software Projects
Learning Objectives:

Integrate Copilot into daily coding, reviews, and team workflows
Use Copilot on larger real-world problems (scaffolding modules, writing tests, generating docs)
Critical thinking: When to trust Copilot—and when to override suggestions
Teaching Structure:

Live multi-step example: Scaffold a microservice/module (Python or C#)
Show edit history, review flow, and security testing
Tips for team collaboration and Copilot settings
Lab 6: Mini End-to-End Project

In pairs or solo: Build a small, real component (e.g., a REST API endpoint or class) using Copilot assistance
Apply prompting, reviews, documentation, and testing as practiced
Share-out: Quick demos or discuss key learnings
