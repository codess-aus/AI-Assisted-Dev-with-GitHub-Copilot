2. How GitHub Copilot Thinks: Mental Models & Context
Learning Objectives:

Understand Copilot’s context window and model
How prompts (code, comments, file context) shape suggestions
Why Copilot sometimes predicts well—and sometimes doesn’t
Teaching Structure:

Explain: Token context, prompt engineering, and model limitations
Demo: Copilot response changes based on surrounding comments/code
Discussion: When context “leaks” or fails, and how to troubleshoot
Lab 2: Context Engineering Experiments

Experiment: Vary comments/instructions and watch code output change
Add docstrings/types/comments for different implementation suggestions
Try contextual copy/paste (e.g., building two functions with related names and observing Copilot’s connections) in Python and C#
