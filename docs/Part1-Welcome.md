Welcome & The Rise of AI-Assisted Development

## ByteStrike's First Moment

ByteStrike sits at their desk, staring at the mission brief. The encrypted blueprints are waiting on a remote server. The deadline is real. And they've never written this particular piece of code before.

This is where most developers pause and think: *"How do I even start?"*

That's where GitHub Copilot comes in. Over the next few parts, you'll see how AI assistance transforms that moment of uncertainty into productive, iterative development.

## Learning Objectives

- Set expectations: This workshop teaches real development patterns using a themed mission
- Understand what AI-assisted coding is and how it's shaping modern development
- Recognize Copilot's capabilities, limitations, and typical workflows
- See how ByteStrike uses AI as a pair programmer, not just an autocomplete tool

## Teaching Structure

- **Brief icebreaker/introductions:** Welcome to ByteStrike's team
- **Overview:** Workshop goals, the ByteStrike mission arc (learn → ask → harden → deploy)
- **Demo:** Copilot helping ByteStrike start the blueprint decoder in Python and C#
- **Discuss:** AI as a pair programmer vs. autocomplete tool
- **Q:** Who's used Copilot before? Share initial impressions

## Lab 1: ByteStrike's First Lines of Code

ByteStrike needs to fetch the encrypted blueprint. Let's help them start:

**Task:**
1. Set up Copilot extension in VS Code (Python and C#)
2. Create a new file: `blueprint_decoder.py` (or `BlueprintDecoder.cs`)
3. Trigger Copilot to suggest a function that fetches a URL and returns the content
4. Observe how Copilot understands the task from just the function name and docstring
5. Challenge: Ask Copilot to extend it to print all lines containing `{*` markers

This is your first taste of how AI assistance works in practice—not magic, but guided iteration.
